        "The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The datasets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The dataset related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data files have been merged together into a single dataset. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some missing values. As the datasets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo,Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these countries was difficult and hence, it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model dataset. The final merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables was then divided into several broad categories:​Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors.\n",

        "This activity was made extra challenging because we are required to find and use two different real world datasets for classification and regression. And the datasets I was able to use needed  to undergo preprocessing and handle its missing values before I can train the models. I encountered a lot of errors that prompt me to try different techniques in order to properly run the code. Moreover, this activity emphasized key lessons in model development ffor both classification and regression. With this, I have learn new knowledge about preprocessing data and model training, and it also improved my understanding about analyzing data and models. Overall, the iterative process of data preprocessing, model building, tuning, and evaluation highlights the importance of experimentation and data understanding in achieving robust machine learning models across different problem domains."
